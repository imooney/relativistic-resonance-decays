	Changed the TestWriterrd.C file so that the Event is written to the tree
	Added the treeRead.C file 
		It reads trees now! I actually don't know what was fixed, but Kolja fixed it
		He said it wasn't connected to the library
		Still more to write if we want to make a histogram or whatever, but it actually reads a tree now
	Make file was changed a little
	Added the rootlogon.C to the folder system
